**Ice CreamSales Prediction using Polynomial Regression**

This report details the implementation of apolynomial regression model to predict ice cream sales based on temperature.The code utilizes Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, andMatplotlib. This implementation is for learning purposes and demonstrates theprocess of data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

**1.Objective**

The objective of this project is to build apredictive model that can estimate ice cream sales based on the correspondingtemperature. Polynomial regression is employed to capture potential non-linearrelationships between temperature and sales.

**2\. Dataset**

The code reads data from a CSV file named"Ice\_cream selling data.csv". This file is assumed to contain twocolumns: "Temperature" (independent variable) and "Ice CreamSales" (dependent variable). It's crucial that the dataset is properlyformatted and accessible to the script. The first column is assumed to betemperature and the second one is Ice Cream Sales.

**3\. CodeExplanation**

**Step-by-step breakdown:**

1.  **Import Libraries:** Necessary libraries are imported for data manipulation, preprocessing, model training, and visualization.
    

4.  **Load Data:** The pd.read\_csv() function reads the data from the specified CSV file.
    

6.  **Separate Features and Target:** The code extracts the temperature (X) and ice cream sales (Y) from the dataset.
    

8.  **Handle Missing Values:** The SimpleImputer replaces any missing values (NaN) in the temperature column with the mean of that column.
    

10.  **Feature Scaling:** The StandardScaler scales the temperature data to have zero mean and unit variance. This is important for many machine learning algorithms, including linear regression.
    

12.  **Polynomial Feature Transformation:** The PolynomialFeatures class creates polynomial features up to the specified degree (4 in this case). This transforms the original feature (temperature) into a set of features like temperature, temperature squared, temperature cubed, and temperature to the power of 4. This allows the model to learn non-linear relationships.
    

14.  **Train Linear Regression Model:** A linear regression model is trained on the generated polynomial features. Even though we're using polynomial features, the underlying model is still _linear_ regression in the higher-dimensional space created by the polynomial transformation.
    

16.  **Make Predictions:** The trained model is used to predict ice cream sales based on the temperature data.
    

18.  **Visualize Results:** The code generates a scatter plot of actual sales vs. temperature and overlays the predicted sales from the polynomial regression model.
    

20.  **Evaluate Model:** The R-squared score is calculated to evaluate the goodness of fit of the model. A higher R-squared value (closer to 1) indicates a better fit.
    

**4\. How toRun the Code (.ipynb file)**

1.  **Install Jupyter Notebook:** If you don't have it already, install Jupyter Notebook. You can typically do this using pip: pip install notebook
    

2.  **Create a new notebook:** In Jupyter Notebook, click "New" and select "Python 3" (or your preferred Python kernel).
    

6.  **Copy and paste the code:** Copy the entire code provided above and paste it into a cell in your Jupyter Notebook.
    

8.  **Upload the data:** Upload your "Ice\_cream selling data.csv" file to the same directory as your Jupyter Notebook or provide the correct path to the file in the pd.read\_csv() function.
    

10.  **Run the cell:** Click on the cell containing the code and press Shift+Enter (or click the "Run" button).
    

The output (plot and R-squared score) will bedisplayed below the cell.

**5.Conclusion**

This code demonstrates a basic implementationof polynomial regression for predicting ice cream sales. The polynomialfeatures allow the model to capture non-linear relationships betweentemperature and sales. The R-squared score provides a measure of how well themodel fits the data. This implementation is for educational purposes. Forreal-world applications, further steps like hyperparameter tuning,cross-validation, and potentially exploring other models would be beneficial.It's also important to ensure the data is representative and of good quality.
